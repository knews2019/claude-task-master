## 6. UI/UX General Considerations - MVP

*   **Simplicity & Intuitiveness:** The UI should be self-explanatory. Minimize clicks and cognitive load.
*   **Clean Aesthetics:** Modern, uncluttered design.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Project Navigation:** A clear way to list and switch between projects (e.g., a sidebar).
    *   **Task View Area:** Main area for displaying tasks (list or board).
    *   **Task Board View:** Columns for "To Do", "In Progress", "Completed". Tasks represented as cards.
*   **Visual Cues:** Use color or icons sparingly and effectively to denote priority, status, or task type if necessary.
*   **Performance:** The application should feel responsive for typical MVP-level data loads (e.g., tens of projects, hundreds of tasks).
*   **Consistency:** UI elements and interactions should be consistent throughout the application.
*   **Error Handling (Basic):** Provide clear, user-friendly messages for simple errors (e.g., invalid input).
*   **Accessibility (Basic Considerations):** Aim for reasonable color contrast, keyboard navigability for main actions. Full WCAG compliance is post-MVP.
*   **No Complex Setup:** Users should be able to start using the application immediately (e.g., no installation beyond opening a web page, no complex configuration).
*   **Single Page Application (SPA) Feel:** Aim for smooth transitions and updates without full page reloads for most actions.

## 7. Technical Considerations - MVP

*   **Application Type:** Client-side Single Page Application (SPA). No backend server for user data persistence in MVP.
*   **Frontend Technology Stack (Options - to be decided):**
    *   **Option 1 (Lightweight):** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (or with a small utility library like Preact/SolidJS if componentization is strongly desired with minimal overhead).
    *   **Option 2 (Framework-based):** React, Vue, or Svelte. This might be overkill for MVP but sets up for future growth.
    *   Decision criteria: Development speed for MVP, learning curve (if any for the dev team), performance, future scalability.
*   **Data Storage (Client-Side - Critical Decision):**
    *   **Option A: Browser Local Storage:**
        *   Pros: Simple to implement, widely supported.
        *   Cons: Limited storage (typically 5-10MB), synchronous API (can block UI if not handled carefully), data tied to a specific browser/domain, not easily user-accessible outside the app.
    *   **Option B: File System Access API (with fallback or user instruction):**
        *   Pros: Allows users to save/load data to/from files they control (e.g., `tasks.json`), more robust storage, data is portable.
        *   Cons: Newer API, not supported in all browsers (Firefox behind a flag, Safari partial), requires user permission prompts. Might need a fallback to Local Storage or clear instructions for users on unsupported browsers.
    *   **MVP Data Format:** Aim to be compatible with the existing `tasks.json` structure if feasible, or define a clear, simple JSON structure.
*   **State Management:**
    *   For Vanilla JS: Simple objects/arrays, potentially with a pub/sub pattern for updates.
    *   For Frameworks: Built-in capabilities (e.g., React Context/useState, Vuex, Svelte Stores).
*   **Build Tools (if using framework/TS/advanced CSS):** Vite, Parcel, or Webpack.
*   **Version Control:** Git.
*   **Modularity:** Structure code for maintainability (e.g., separate modules for UI components, data handling, business logic).
*   **Compatibility with `tasks.json` (CLI):**
    *   If File System Access API is used, can it directly read/write the CLI's `tasks.json`?
    *   If Local Storage is used, how does this impact users who also use the CLI? (Likely separate data stores initially).

## 8. Success Metrics - MVP

*   **Core Functionality Completion:** All defined MVP features (project/task CRUD, board/list view, status changes, basic subtasks) are implemented and working.
*   **Stability:** Application is free of critical bugs that prevent core task management.
*   **Qualitative Usability:**
    *   Feedback from a small group of test users indicates the GUI is intuitive and easy to use for its intended purpose.
    *   Users can successfully create projects, add tasks, change task statuses, and understand the project overview without extensive instruction.
*   **Task Management Effectiveness:** Users report that the tool helps them organize and track their tasks effectively for individual projects.
*   **Concept Validation:** Positive initial feedback suggests that a web GUI for Task Master is a worthwhile direction.
*   **Adherence to MVP Scope:** Features are delivered as specified, without significant scope creep that delays MVP.
*   **(Optional) Basic Quantitative Measures (if wider testing is possible):**
    *   Number of projects/tasks created by test users.
    *   Time taken to complete common actions.

## 9. Future Considerations - Post-MVP

*   **User Accounts & Authentication:** Secure user login and registration.
*   **Cloud Synchronization:** Store data in the cloud (e.g., using Firebase, Supabase, or a custom backend) for multi-device access and backup.
*   **Collaboration Features:**
    *   Sharing projects with other users.
    *   Assigning tasks to team members.
    *   Comments on tasks.

    *   Smart task suggestions.
    *   Automatic prioritization.
    *   Natural Language Processing for task creation.
*   **Enhanced Reporting & Analytics:** More detailed dashboards, charts, and exportable reports.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Themes (dark mode, etc.).
    *   More view options (calendar view, timeline view).
    *   Full mobile responsiveness and PWA features.
*   **Import/Export:** Robust options for importing from and exporting to various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.).
*   **Performance Optimization:** For larger datasets and more users.
*   **Settings/Configuration:** User preferences for application behavior and appearance.
*   **Integrations:** Connect with calendars, email, code repositories, etc.

## 10. Open Questions

*   **Data Storage for MVP - Final Decision:** Given pros/cons, which client-side storage mechanism (Local Storage vs. File System Access API) is preferred for the MVP? This has significant implications for user experience and data portability.
*   **UI/UX Specifics - Board vs. List View:** Should both be MVP, or prioritize one? If board view, what are the exact columns and are they customizable?
*   **Subtask Implementation Detail:** How deep should subtask functionality go? Just a checklist, or can subtasks have their own (limited) properties?
*   **Task Dependencies:** Explicitly out of MVP, but are there any very basic linking concepts to consider if simple? (Likely no, stick to MVP).
*   **Technical Stack - Final Decision:** Which specific JS framework/library (if any) should be used for the MVP?
*   **Performance Expectations:** What are the acceptable load times and interaction responsiveness targets for the MVP (e.g., with 10 projects and 200 total tasks)?
*   **Interoperability with CLI `tasks.json`:** If File System Access API is chosen, how strictly must the GUI adhere to the existing `tasks.json` schema? Can the GUI extend it with GUI-specific metadata if needed, and how would the CLI handle that? If Local Storage is chosen, acknowledge data separation.
*   **Error Handling Details:** What specific error scenarios need graceful handling in the MVP?
*   **"Definition of Done" for Tasks/Projects:** Are there any specific criteria (beyond status change) that signify completion from a user perspective? (e.g., all subtasks complete automatically completes parent task?) - For MVP, keep simple: manual status change is sufficient.
